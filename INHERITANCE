*Inheritance :

1) Inheritance is a process in which one object acquires all the properties and
behaviors of its parent object automatically. 
2) In such a way, you can reuse, extend or modify the attributes and behaviors which are defined in other
classes.

<<<<In C++
The class which inherits the members of another class is called
derived class and the class whose members are inherited is called base class.

The derived class is the specialized class for the base class.



***C++ Syntax :
class derived_class :: visibility-mode base_class;
